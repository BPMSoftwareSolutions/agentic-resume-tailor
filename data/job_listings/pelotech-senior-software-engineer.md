## Full job description
Software Engineer (Passionate Polyglots, Versatile Specialists, or Curious Experts needed!)

We're Pelotech. We are deeply technical but also deeply human: approachable, adaptable, curious, and helpful. We aren't here to blindly build features; we're here to solve problems thoughtfully.

## When we say we're weird, we mean:

We're just as likely to have spirited debates about the best surfing techniques as we are about Kubernetes configurations
We've got Slack channels for #tech-geeking-out and #random ones for pictures of your family picnic dinners
We prefer kindness and curiosity over being right every time
You might call yourself a passionate polyglot, a versatile specialist, or a curious expert. You’re fluent in multiple technologies but especially nerdy in one or two. You’re adaptable, curious, and proudly geeky about your specialty.

Your mindset is just as important as your technical skill set. We work closely with client teams, mentoring, guiding, and helping them improve their software development. That means you'll need to communicate clearly, empathetically, and effectively.

## You’ll fit right in if:

You learn fast. You can write code in a language you've never seen before on the same day you see it for the first time. You won't be an expert immediately, but you are capable quickly.
You enjoy collaborating closely with others and are comfortable sharing opinions and explaining your thought processes.
You have tech opinions you are passionate about! For example, I’m nerdy about programming language type systems and where the useful/academic line gets drawn. I think Scala libraries like Cats are lost in the academic sauce. We want to hear what you have spent time thinking deeply about.
You thrive when projects are ambiguous and unstructured. You don't panic when details are fuzzy; you see uncertainty as an interesting puzzle and strive to find the why behind the work.
You're pragmatic. You prefer shipping over perfection. You ask for help when you need it.
You have ideas about How Things Should Be, but you can work with How It Is until we have a chance to improve things. Strong opinions are welcome, but egos are not.
You understand work isn't everything. You have passions outside of work—surfing, playing music, or raising a family—and you’re excited to share them with the team.
‍What You’ll Do:

Quickly pick up the context and become trusted by clients—not just as a developer, but as someone who genuinely makes their lives easier.
Embed yourself in our clients’ engineering teams and mentor and coach their engineers. Be the senior engineer you always wished you had.
Write code. Deploy stuff. Discuss how to structure tests. Come up with weird hacks to push stuff forward. Figure out ways to make things better.‍
Who Should Apply?

## This is probably a great fit if:

You’ve worked professionally as a software developer for at least 3 years‍
You're a hands-on software engineer first, proficient in 3–4 common programming languages (Javascript/Typescript, Go, Python, Java, etc.) with a lean towards backend dev.
You have familiarity with DevOps/cloud-native tooling (Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, AWS, GCP, etc.)—you don’t need to be an expert, but you should be capable
You’ve gone deep on at least one technology, and you can espouse endlessly about what you love and hate about it and other options
Why Pelotech?

Look, we know every company says they're "different," but Pelotech genuinely is. Here’s what makes this a special place:

‍We take care of each other: Burnout happens—we know that. When it does, we shuffle work around, swap places, help each other out, and make sure everyone can recharge.

‍Trust and autonomy: You're a grown-up engineer; we trust you. See something broken? Fix it. Have an idea? Pitch it. You're not just "allowed," you're actively encouraged.

‍You'll never stop growing: We regularly step into chaotic, messy, real-world problems—and leave them significantly better than we found them. If you crave variety and growth, there's nowhere better.
