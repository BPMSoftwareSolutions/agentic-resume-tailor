Are you a backend-focused Engineering Manager ready to take ownership of complex distributed systems and shape the direction of a fast-growing AI startup?

This is an incredible opportunity to step into a hands-on leadership role at a company that's redefining the future of fashion and retail through cutting-edge AI, 3D, and real-time rendering. Backed by top-tier investors and industry leaders, the company is gearing up for a major global product launch that will transform how millions of users experience fashion online.

Founded five years ago, they've built one of the most advanced photorealistic virtual try-on platforms in the market. Their technology sits at the intersection of computer vision, rendering, and machine learning, and they're now entering a hyper-growth phase where scalable backend systems and strong engineering leadership are absolutely critical.

As Engineering Manager, you'll lead a small team of engineers while remaining close to the code yourself. You'll set the technical direction for a complex Go-based microservices architecture, shape development practices, and collaborate across product, ML, and frontend teams to deliver high-performance systems at scale.

This is a unique chance to join at a pivotal inflection point, where your impact will be felt across the entire product and organization. If you thrive in fast-paced, ambitious environments and love building both systems and teams, this is the role to accelerate your career!

The Role

Lead and mentor engineers while contributing hands-on to high-impact systems and APIs
Architect and scale Go microservices powering AI, rendering, and data processing pipelines
Define engineering standards, drive code quality, and implement best practices across distributed systems
Partner closely with cross-functional teams to deliver performant, reliable, and scalable backend infrastructure

The Person

Strong backend engineering experience with deep expertise in Golang and distributed systems
Proven track record leading teams or projects in fast-moving startup environments
Skilled with modern cloud and DevOps technologies including AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD
Hands-on technical leader comfortable owning architecture while staying close to implementation
Excited by the intersection of AI, 3D, and real-time systems, and motivated to build at global scale
