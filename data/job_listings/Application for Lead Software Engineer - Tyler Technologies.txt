Team Enablement and Growth
 
•	Mentor and coach engineers, providing opportunities for growth and ensuring excellence in software engineering practices.
•	Take on challenging tasks beyond the team's current capabilities to help them stretch and grow, while contributing your own coding expertise.
•	Encourage risk-taking and experimentation, while minimizing the impact of failed experiments and maximizing the learning experience.
•	Increase team autonomy and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
 
Collaboration and Standards
 
•	Work with Enterprise Architecture to maintain and extend technical guidance, standards, and guardrails specific to the product line.
•	Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure that design choices align with business and architecture strategy.
 
Qualifications:
