Get to know Okta

Okta is The World's Identity Company. We free everyone to safely use any technology, anywhere, on any device or app. Our flexible and neutral products, Okta Platform and Auth0 Platform, provide secure access, authentication, and automation, placing identity at the core of business security and growth.

At Okta, we celebrate a variety of perspectives and experiences. We are not looking for someone who checks every single box - we're looking for lifelong learners and people who can make us better with their unique experiences.

Join our team! We're building a world where Identity belongs to you.

At Okta, we're building the next generation of authentication for the GenAI era.

We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the AI DevEx team at Auth0. This role is pivotal in extending and complementing our Auth for GenAI offering by building the infrastructure, tooling, and developer experiences that empower both human developers and AI agents to build secure, intelligent applications.

Auth0 Emerging Tech is the Engineering organization where we take care of the hottest technology out there: we ship fast, we don't break things. We are a dynamic and collaborative distributed and diverse team. We value ownership, learning and innovation.

This is an ideal role for an engineer who enjoys building for other engineers, working across stacks, and shaping the future of AI enablement in production systems. You'll collaborate across engineering, product, and security teams to drive meaningful improvements in developer tooling, agent authentication, orchestration frameworks, and real-world demos.

Responsibilities
Design and Build Developer Tooling that helps developers secure and manage infrastructure like MCP servers
Build Demo Applications that showcase secure, identity-powered AI use cases in real-world environments
Contribute to Open Source Projects, both within Auth0 and across the broader AI + identity ecosystem
Write and Maintain High-Quality Documentation including API references, quickstarts, and best practices for both developers and AI-native tooling (e.g., llm.txt)
Drive Integration with Emerging AI Frameworks by creating adapters, utilities, and interfaces for agent runtimes and orchestration layers
Collaborate with Design, Product, and Security teams to align on developer needs, roadmap direction, and compliance requirements
Ensure Resilience and Security of systems involved in agent-to-agent or model-to-service communication

You Might Be a Good Fit If You
4+ years of experience in software engineering with a proven track record in building tools, frameworks, or platforms for other developers
Proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang and/or Python, and the ability to move fluidly between front-end and back-end contexts
Experience working with LLM APIs, agent runtimes, orchestration layers, or prompt pipelines
Familiarity with authentication and authorization systems, especially standards like OAuth2, OIDC, and JWT
Demonstrated experience leading architecture and design efforts for scalable, production-grade systems
Comfort contributing to and maintaining open source projects and engaging with developer communities
A passion for documentation as part of the developer experience—not just writing code, but making it understandable and usable
Ability to thrive in highly collaborative environments with cross-functional stakeholders

Technologies You May Work With
Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
Frameworks: React, Next.js, FastAPI
AI Ecosystem: Model APIs, orchestration runtimes, prompt management systems, agent toolkits
Auth0 Stack: Token Vault, Async Authorization, Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)
