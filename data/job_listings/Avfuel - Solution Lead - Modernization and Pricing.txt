Description

We’re seeking a hands-on technical leader to join our IT organization as the Solution Lead – Modernization and Pricing. This role combines enterprise solution architecture with hands-on development, providing the technical leadership Avfuel needs as we modernize core systems and implement next-generation pricing and integration solutions. You will play a critical role in ensuring platform sustainability, scalability, and readiness for global growth.

Responsibilities

Lead modernization of the legacy CRM platform into scalable, object-oriented enterprise solutions while supporting business growth and resolving issues.
Evaluate, architect, and integrate enterprise off-the-shelf pricing engines and CPQ platforms with business systems.
Contribute hands-on in C# .NET, SQL Server (T-SQL, PL-SQL), and Oracle, while mentoring senior developers.
Collaborate with IT leadership, business owners, and external vendors to align technology with corporate strategy.
Ensure long-term platform sustainability and readiness for global growth.
Design and deliver solutions that modularize and decouple core business logic into a scalable, service-based framework.
Other duties as assigned by management.
Requirements

7+ years of advanced programming experience in an object-oriented language (C++, C#, or Java).
Strong SQL development skills (any platform; Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle preferred).
5+ years of experience modernizing legacy applications (CRM platforms, SalesLogix, VBScript, or similar) using object-oriented design.
Expertise in enterprise pricing engines and CPQ solutions (examples include PriceFX, Vendavo, Oracle CPQ, or similar platforms).
Solid integration background: APIs, SSIS, MQ/event-driven streaming, SOAP/REST, XML/JSON.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills to bridge business and technical teams.
Flexibility and adaptability to the environment: we value specialists who bring depth in their own background, but who are also willing to work with the languages and platforms in place (for example, transitioning between Java, C#, or even legacy VBScript where necessary).
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
