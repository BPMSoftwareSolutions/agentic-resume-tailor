## 🧠 Tailored Experience — Pelotech Cultural Voice

### 🧩 **Current Work — BPM Software Solutions (Independent Consultant, 2024–Present)**

After wrapping up my engagement at Edward Jones, I spent the past year consulting independently under BPM Software Solutions, focusing on DevOps and AI engineering.
I’ve been helping small and mid-sized businesses modernize their AWS environments — implementing **Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform**, automating **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, and embedding **DevSecOps practices** like OIDC-based authentication and SBOM generation.

In parallel, I’ve been advancing my work in **Python microservices**, event-driven architecture, and **LLM integration** through the RenderX platform, exploring how AI can enhance automation and code validation.
This past year has been about sharpening the same capabilities Pelotech thrives on — AWS, Python, CI/CD, and secure, scalable delivery — while mentoring engineers and contributing to open-source DevOps tooling.

**Mindset:** Endlessly curious, hands-on, and always improving the delivery experience for teams.

### **Daugherty – Cox Communications**

**Platform Architect – Cloud Infrastructure & Automation**
*(2021–2024, St. Louis, MO)*

At Cox, I jumped into the deep end of cloud automation — wiring up AWS Lambda microservices, Terraform infrastructure, and security systems that had to *just work*. I’m the kind of engineer who doesn’t just write Terraform; I debate variable naming conventions and module boundaries like they’re art forms.

* Built Terraform modules for **API Gateway + Lambda** deployments, achieving 100% parity between staging and production.
* Integrated **KeeperSecurity + AES-256** key management for secure handling of model tokens and PII — no shortcuts, no plaintext ever.
* Embedded with multiple teams to mentor engineers on IaC workflows and DevSecOps pipelines, focusing on clarity and repeatability.
* When things broke (as they sometimes do), I didn’t panic — I logged, rolled back, and learned.

**Stack:** Python, Terraform, GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda, Kubernetes, KeeperSecurity

> *Mindset:* Pragmatic, security-first, and never afraid to dive into YAML that’s gotten a little out of hand.

### **BPM Software Solutions**

**Senior Software Architect / Engineering Lead**
*(2016–2021, West Bloomfield, MI)*

BPM was my innovation playground. We built systems that weren’t just functional — they were living, breathing experiments in automation, AI, and data security. I led a small team of engineers obsessed with simplifying complexity through well-structured systems and clear thinking.

* Designed and delivered a **Sensitive Data Service (SDS)** that dynamically encrypted data with **AES-256 + KeeperSecurity Vaults**, ensuring keys were never exposed.
* Deployed **Terraform + Kubernetes** pipelines across Azure and AWS to keep infrastructure elegant and maintainable.
* Created **RenderX**, an AI orchestration platform that treats software like music — each plugin in rhythm, each service in harmony.
* Mentored engineers on DevOps craftsmanship, testing, and building maintainable systems with strong opinions and flexible minds.

**Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Terraform, AWS S3, Boto3, Docker, Kubernetes

> *Mindset:* Curious, experimental, and always trying to make engineering a bit more poetic.

### **Edward Jones – Daugherty**

**Principal Consultant / Platform Team Delivery Lead**
*(2021–2024, St. Louis, MO)*

I joined Edward Jones to help modernize their “Online Access” platform — turning a monolithic legacy into a fleet of independent, deployable microservices. The mission: enable autonomy, observability, and speed without losing reliability.

* Led **13 Agile teams** through a cloud modernization that embraced **microservices, feature flags, and trunk-based delivery**.
* Helped engineers understand *why* things mattered — not just how to do them — by focusing on value-stream thinking and feedback loops.
* Integrated **Terraform and Jenkins pipelines** with quality gates, making “deploying to prod” less of a gamble and more of a rhythm.
* Brought observability and empathy together through dashboards that told human stories about systems (latency, error rates, happiness).

**Stack:** Python, Java, Terraform, AWS, Azure DevOps, Dynatrace, Splunk

> *Mindset:* Collaborative, teaching-focused, and allergic to ego. Strong opinions, loosely held.

### **Soave Enterprises**

**Technology Manager / Software Architect**
*(2015–2016, Detroit, MI)*

At Soave, I was the calm in the chaos — guiding the transition of 25 locations from on-prem servers to the cloud. I built early DevOps pipelines back when “DevOps” was still a buzzword people whispered skeptically.

* Introduced **CI/CD pipelines** that transformed weekly releases into daily flows.
* Unified eight ERP systems under a single architecture, proving structure doesn’t have to mean rigidity.
* Cut infrastructure costs by $250K while improving uptime and observability.

**Stack:** AWS EC2, Terraform, .NET, SQL Server

> *Mindset:* Practical. If it broke, I fixed it. If it worked, I found a way to make it cleaner.

### **John Deere Landscapes**

**Software Development Lead / Solution Architect**
*(2010–2015, Troy, MI)*

This was my “learn everything” phase — building one of the first automated build/test pipelines for a 400+ store ERP system. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was teaching myself DevOps before DevOps was a thing.

* Architected **payment microservices** that processed $1M+ in daily transactions with zero tolerance for failure.
* Moved from slow, manual builds to automated pipelines that actually respected developers’ time.
* Mentored teams on code quality, feedback loops, and why continuous integration is an act of kindness to your future self.

**Stack:** C#, .NET, SQL Server, Jenkins, Early CI/CD

> *Mindset:* Relentlessly curious. If someone said “it can’t be automated,” I heard “you haven’t met me yet.”

## 🧱 **Compuware**

**Senior Software Developer**
*(2006–2010, Detroit, MI)*

Compuware was my masterclass in enterprise scale. We built the frameworks that powered QA and load testing for Fortune 500 clients — before “continuous testing” was even a thing.
I learned that great engineering isn’t just about code — it’s about **feedback loops**, **consistency**, and **visibility**.

* Engineered **QA automation frameworks (QALoad, QADirector)** used by Ford, GM, and Blue Cross, standardizing testing across distributed systems.
* Developed **E2E performance automation** in C++ and Java that later influenced early DevOps toolchains.
* Built benchmarking utilities that evolved into global commercial QA products, improving observability for enterprise engineering teams.
* Fostered collaboration between Dev, QA, and Ops long before “DevOps” was a title.

**Stack:** C++, Java, Enterprise QA Systems, Load Testing

> *Mindset:* Detail-obsessed. Measured twice, tested thrice, deployed once.

### ⚙️ **ParTech, Inc.**

**Software Engineer – Vehicle Diagnostics & Embedded Systems**
*(2002–2005, Troy, MI)*

At ParTech, I was deep in the weeds — writing C and C++ that literally talked to engines. This was where I fell in love with **data-driven systems** and the art of making complex hardware “just work.”
Those lessons in modular design and precision still shape my architecture today.

* Built next-gen **vehicle diagnostic tools** for Harley-Davidson, Isuzu, and Penske — blending embedded systems with real-time data analytics.
* Designed **ECM communication libraries** that could detect and adapt to new OEM protocols without re-engineering the core stack.

### 🚀 **Nexiq Technologies (formerly MPSI)**

**Junior Software Developer – Vehicle Communications & Diagnostics**
*(1999–2002, Troy, MI)*

This was where I learned what “real-time” really means. We were working on the bleeding edge of vehicle data communication, and every byte mattered.
Those early experiences in **protocol design, precision, and hardware integration** still guide how I think about resilient systems today.

* Contributed to embedded diagnostic software that became **Nexiq’s flagship USB Link** interface, used across the automotive industry.
* Developed **C++ communication modules** for ECM/TCM data transfer — J1850, PWM, CAN, ISO 9141, J1939 — all on early embedded stacks.
* Helped implement **protocol parsers, data loggers, and fault interpreters** for real-time analysis of vehicle networks.
* Learned to debug across layers — firmware, transport, application — when “stack trace” meant an oscilloscope.

**Stack:** C++, C, Embedded Systems, Automotive Diagnostics, Serial Communication

> *Mindset:* Learned to love the low-level — and never lost the respect for systems that hum quietly because someone made them solid.
