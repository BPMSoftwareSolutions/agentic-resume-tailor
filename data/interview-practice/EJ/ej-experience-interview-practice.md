**Key value:** Improved transparency, reliability, and data-driven operations
**Tech keywords:** Dynatrace | Splunk | Observability | Event-Driven Alerting | Metrics Culture

---

### 🧭 5. Leadership & Mentorship

> “As the **Platform Team Delivery Lead**, I mentored platform engineers and architects on continuous delivery, domain-driven design, and feature-flag deployment. That mentoring accelerated our DevOps maturity and built lasting technical leadership across the organization.”

**Key value:** Elevated culture and technical standards
**Tech keywords:** DevOps Coaching | DDD | Feature Flags | Agile Leadership

---

### 🧠 6. Foundation for AI-Readiness

> “While the focus was modernization, we also built **AI-ready service infrastructure**, laying the groundwork for natural language and recommendation systems to plug into existing APIs — essentially preparing Edward Jones for its LLM integration roadmap.”

**Key value:** Future-proofed architecture for AI and automation
**Tech keywords:** API Orchestration | AI-Readiness | LLM Integration | REST APIs | Cloud Scalability

---

### 🧩 7. Cross-Functional Delivery Governance

> “I established **technical delivery governance** across multiple trains — standardizing code quality metrics, automation practices, and security gates. This unified over a dozen teams behind a single definition of ‘done,’ enabling consistent velocity across product lines.”

**Key value:** Improved cross-team consistency and delivery predictability
**Tech keywords:** Governance | CI/CD Standards | Quality Metrics | Agile Transformation

---

### 🪶 Optional “Signature Story”

> “One of my favorite outcomes was when we reduced monthly release lead time from two weeks to just two days — not through new tools, but by rethinking how code flowed through our CI/CD ecosystem. It was a perfect example of how **architecture and process alignment** create real business impact.”
