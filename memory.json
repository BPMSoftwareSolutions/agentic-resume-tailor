When a user asks to tailor their resume,\nyou should:\n\n1. Ask for the job description file path (e.g., data/job_listings/Sr. Software Engineer - at Credibly.md)\n   or URL if not provided\n2. Ask for the resume JSON file path (e.g., data/resumes/a041bd2e-d54b-488f-adda-e4c707d5332d.json or\n   data/master_resume.json) if not provided\n3. Ask for output format preferences (HTML with theme, or markdown, and whether DOCX is needed)\n4. Generate the appropriate command to execute\n\nCommon tailoring intents include phrases like:\n- \"tailor my resume\"\n- \"fit my resume to this job\"\n- \"customize resume for\"\n- \"adapt my resume\"\n- \"optimize resume for this position\"\n\nWhen you detect a tailoring intent, help gather the required information and suggest the appropriate\ncommand using the 'run:' prefix.\n\nExample commands:\n- Markdown: run: python src/tailor.py --resume data/master_resume.json --jd \"data/job_listings/job.md\" --out out/tailored.md --format markdown\n- HTML: run: python src/tailor.py --resume data/master_resume.json --jd \"data/job_listings/job.md\" --out out/tailored.html --format html --theme professional\n- HTML with DOCX: run: python src/tailor.py --resume data/master_resume.json --jd \"data/job_listings/job.md\" --out out/tailored.html --format html --theme professional --docx\n\nAvailable themes: professional, modern, executive, creative\n"

    "content": "As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm currently not capable of reviewing codebases or evaluating specific programming projects. My current abilities deal with processing text-based data, generating human-like text, and supporting users with queries based on my training data, so I wouldn't be able to provide a direct summary of your codebase. However, you can ask questions related to code! I can help explain programming concepts, discuss best practices, and answer other code-related questions you might have to the best of my ability."

Here's a rough step-by-step strategy:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository onto your local machine.\n\n2. **Directory Structure**: Navigate through the directory structure of the project to get a feel for how it's organized. Look for a `src/` directory for source code, a `test/` directory for tests, a `bin/` or `dist/` directory for build artifacts, etc.\n\n3. **Package/Project Configuration Files**: Examine any package or project configuration files (e.g. `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `setup.py`, etc.). These files are usually present in the root directory.\n\n4. **Documentation**: If present, check `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the `docs/` directory. These files often provide invaluable context about the project.\n\n5. **Examine Important Files**: Following the cues from the project's directory structure and documentation, identify and open a few key files.\n\n6. **Code Analysis Tools**: Use code analysis tools to get metrics about the codebase. This can help assess the overall quality and maintainability of the code.\n\n7. **Dependencies**: Check the libraries and frameworks the project is dependent on. Are there any old versions or outdated libraries being used?\n\n8. **Testing Suit and CI/CD files**: Look for unit tests, integration tests and CI/CD pipeline files (like `.travis.yml` for Travis CI or `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins).\n\nNote: Depending upon the programming language used in the project, there may be language-specific tools or strategies that could be used! \n\nRemember the aim of the code review is not only to understand the codebase but also to identify possible areas of improvement regarding code efficiency, maintainability, readability, among others."
